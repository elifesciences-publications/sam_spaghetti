File architecture requirements for executing the scripts
################################################################################

The execution of the quantification scripts require a number of directories to be passed as arguments, and will rely on several files that should be found in these directories to work properly.

The general idea is that the set of microscope image files (.czi, .lsm and .tif formats are supported) corresponding to one experiment are placed in a given folder, with no naming constraints.

However, all the files generated by the pipeline follow a very strict nomenclature that requires some manual configuration by the user, through the definition of configuration CSV files.
